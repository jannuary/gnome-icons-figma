# GNOME Icon Library for Figma
This is a Figma project containing icons from GNOME's [icon development kit](https://gitlab.gnome.org/Teams/Design/icon-development-kit) repository, because Figma doesn't let me publish to their own "Community" tab.

All credits go to the contributors of that repository, this just packages the icons to a Figma project as assets for easy usage in mockups.
